# Efficient-HAR-Hybrid
This repository contains the implementation of our paper:  **"E-harnet: an efficient hybrid transformer network for human activity recognition"**

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
Human Action Recognition (HAR) is an emerging research area with applications in surveillance, healthcare, and more. 
We propose a novel and efficient hybrid framework that combines **EfficientNet-B0** (spatial feature extraction) and a 
**Vision Transformer (ViT)** (temporal modeling). A **Focal Loss function** is applied to handle class imbalance.

Our framework achieves **competitive accuracy** on three challenging datasets:
- UCF50
- YouTube Action
- HMDB51
